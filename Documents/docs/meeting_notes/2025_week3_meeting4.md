### Topic 3: Addressing Aya's Question
- **Question**:
  - “How to make that decision and how that would impact our grade on the project. I was concerned that we would not make the best possible game if we were trying to learn new skills along the way, which would possibly lower our grade?”
- **Answer from the Professor**:
  - "They focus on the process when grading, not the outcome, and want to see how we were thinking and developing ourselves as a team. He seemed really excited and happy and said that its great that we are even thinking this way and that if we wrote about this process of choosing roles and how the outcome was in our report, this could actually boost our grades."
- **Summary**:
  - The professor emphasized that the grading focuses on **the process** rather than just the outcome. They are looking for how the team works together, thinks critically, and grows through the project.
  - Highlighted that documenting the **role selection process** and its outcomes could positively impact the grade.

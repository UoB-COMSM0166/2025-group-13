What to fine-tune according to Copilot summary:
1.  Improve Visual Consistency and Animation:
- Ensure consistency in the art style across all elements (e.g., fire, platforms, backgrounds) to maintain a cohesive visual experience 
- Add running animations for the main character to replace the sliding animation, and ensure all animations (e.g., flames, dino movements) are consistent and noticeable.

 2. Adjust Jumping Mechanics and Gravity:
- Modify the jumping mechanics to make them more intuitive and realistic. Consider implementing a parabolic jump and adjusting the gravity to make the jump and fall speeds feel more natural.
- Ensure the jump can only be executed once until the key is released and pressed again, as this is the standard expectation.

3. Enhance User Feedback and Health Indicators:
- Make it clearer when the player is losing health by adding visual and audio cues, such as flashing the screen red or adding a glow effect around the health bar.
- Improve the visibility and understanding of health-related elements, such as indicating that ice spikes cause damage and making the health bar more noticeable when it decreases.
